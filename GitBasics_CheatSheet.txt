This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:
Commands related to a remote repository:
    $ git clone "SSH name pulled from Github"
    $ git push or git push origin main [uploads work to GitHub repository]
Commands related to the workflow:
    $ git add . [this adds all files in the current directory and all subsequent directories to the staging area]
    $ git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
Commands related to checking status or log history
    $ git status [current commit progress]
    $ git log [history of actions]
Basic Git syntax is "program | action | destination"
for example "git add ." is read as "git | add | . " where "." represents everything in the current directory
Order: CD into repo > touch or open file > make changes > add or commit > push
